# Note: 
- According to task discription statement "No database support needs to be included, I have used excel data"
- Read data from excel sheet using 'xlsx' package
- And used routing and controller concepts to create APIs.
- DataTable library used for showing table
- For donut chart i have researched multiple libraries and react-donut-chart fits the best according to requirement but it  is not giving control to show the detail box on the left side so it is not 100 % as requirement but have every functionality.
- For google map on home page, I researched possible solutions and found the closest matching one to the requirement.
 which is not 100 %  as requirement.
